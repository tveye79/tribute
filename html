<p class="red-text">(松野 泰己 Matsuno Yasumi?, born 1965) is a Japanese video game designer. He is one of few designers to have two games receive a perfect score by Famitsu magazine: Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII were critically acclaimed with 40 out of 40 points.</p>
<p>his newest game in development is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482445197/unsung-story-tale-of-the-guardians/posts/1543109">Unsung Story</a>
  expected to be released fall 2016</p>
<p>He has been involved with many classic tactical RPGs such as the Ogre Battle series, FFXII, and Vagrant Story.</p>
<p>  "what really defines Matsuno as a game-artist? In a sense, Yasumi Matsuno is the “anti-Sakaguchi”: his tales are always very cold and cynical, his gameplay mechanics are very complex and most often than not, original and groundbreaking"-<a href="https://metavideogame.wordpress.com/tag/yasumi-matsuno/">metavideogame.wordpress.com</a></p>
